# Favorite Shows

This is a project I made at the end of my first web development internship to showcase what I learned about the Angular Framework HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. It lists my favorite shows as cards, and you can click on each one to show a detailed version of the show card. In addition, you can add your own shows to the website using the "Add Show" button and filling in the needed information in the form. I hope you enjoy! 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.12.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
